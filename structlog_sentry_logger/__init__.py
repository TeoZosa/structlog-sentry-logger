""" Users should strive to implement canonical log lines
(when it makes sense).

- Note: the below is a quick primer on the topic; see the
  `original Stripe blog post`_ for more details.

**canonical log lines**: authoritative line for a particular request,
in the same vein that the IETF’s canonical link relation specifies an
authoritative URL.

**In addition to their normal log traces**,
requests (or some other unit of work that’s executing) also emit
ONE LONG LOG LINE at the end that
pulls all its key telemetry into one place. i.e.,

    .. highlight:: bash
    .. code-block:: bash

        [2019-03-18 22:48:32.999]
        "canonical-log-line"
        alloc_count=9123
        auth_type=api_key
        database_queries=34
        duration=0.009
        http_method=POST
        http_path=/v1/charges
        http_status=200
        key_id=mk_123
        permissions_used=account_write
        rate_allowed=true
        rate_quota=100
        rate_remaining=99
        request_id=req_123
        team=acquiring
        user_id=usr_123†

† uuid (aka guid) may be useful
    - i.e., :bash:`user_id = uuid.uuid4()`
    - See also: `When are you truly forced to use UUID as part of the design?`_


The above sample shows the kind of information that a canonical line might
contain:

#. HTTP request:
    - verb
    - path
    - response status
#. Authenticated user and related information, e.g.,
    - authentication method (API key, password)
    - ID of the API key they used
#. Rate limiters which allowed the request and related statistics, e.g.,
    - allotted quota
    - what portion remains
#. Timing information, e.g.,
    - total request duration
    - time spent in database queries
#. Number of:
    - database queries issued
    - objects allocated by the VM
    - etc.

**Canonical lines are an ergonomic feature.**

- By colocating everything that’s important to us, we make it accessible
  through queries that are easy for people to write, even under the duress of a
  production incident.
- Because the underlying logging system doesn’t need to piece together
  multiple log lines at query time they’re also cheap for computers to retrieve
  and aggregate, which makes them fast to use.
- The wide variety of information being logged provides almost limitless
  flexibility in what can be queried. This is especially valuable during the
  discovery phase of an incident where it’s understood that something’s wrong,
  but it’s still a mystery as to what.

Getting insight into e.g., a rate limiting problem, becomes as simple as
(e.g. using Splunk_ and its `built-in query language`_):

- :bash:`canonical-log-line rate_allowed=false | stats count by user_id`
